# Heartbee
Heartbee tracks senior users' heart rate real time using the [Fitbit](www.fitbit.com) watch. If the heart rate increases above a danger threshold and meets certain conditions, we will notify the senior's family and friends immediately and enable online video chat via our paired web and iOS apps. Care for your loved ones, easy as can bee.

Heartbee was born at [AngelHack San Francisco 2018](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/angelhack-san-francisco-hackathon-2018-tickets-45086935237#) over the weekend of July 28-29, created together with my amazing teammates: [Ami Zou](https://github.com/amigomushroom) (Software Engineer), [Gabi Stein](https://github.com/gabistein) (Product Manager + Database Enginner), and Sophia Liu (Designer).

## The Story
Imagine that Madeline is a busy young professional living in the city, and her grandma lives alone in Chinatown. Madeline's grandma has high blood pressure and heart disease. Even though grandma doesn’t speak English, she’s stubbornly independent, loves to do things herself like grocery shop. A month ago, Madeline went to grandma's place for dinner. Madeline arrived, found grandma on the ground short of breath. She was suffering from a fast heart rate. Madeline wished she could have taken care of grandma during an emergency like this, but it’s not easy to check up on your elderly parents when they insist on living alone.

San Francisco Chinatown is full of elderly citizens like Madeline's grandma. According to the statistics, more than 70% of them suffer from cardiovascular disease. We want to connect elderly parents and their family members in a way that doesn’t intrude on their independence, but make sure they’re being taken care of.
